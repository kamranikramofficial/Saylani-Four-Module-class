# Full Stack Simple Website

This is a simple full-stack project that demonstrates basic communication between frontend and backend. The website contains only one button, and when you click it, you will receive a message from the backend.

To use this project, follow these steps:

First, clone the project to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>

Then go to the backend folder:
cd backend
npm install
npm run nodemon

After running the backend, open another terminal and go to the frontend folder:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Once both servers are running, open the frontend link shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173). Click the button and youâ€™ll see the backend message displayed on the page.

This project is a simple example of frontend-backend interaction using Node.js for the backend and a basic frontend setup for the client side.
